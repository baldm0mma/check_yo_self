## Learning Goals

The Check Yo' Self project is designed to implement JavaScript principles taught during the first five weeks at the Turing School. The project builds on the applications of JavaScript to provide a dynamic, functional website that can be used to store ideas, that persists upon a refresh of the page, and that can be deleted from localStorage. Check Yo' Self  requires proficient use of Git and GitHub to track feature changes, and requires mastery of the fundamentals of Flexbox and CSS Grid.

Student were also challenged to use a project management tool of choice, mine being Trello.
